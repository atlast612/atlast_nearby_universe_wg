# AtLAST Nearby Universe & Galaxies Science Case Working Group

This is a community effort for the AtLAST telescope design! Here is a place for summarizing our working group's discussions! What would we like to learn about nearby galaxies? star formation laws? states and statistics of the ISM? anything that you have expertise in? Please feel free to express any idea you have in Slack #nearby_galaxies-case_study!
